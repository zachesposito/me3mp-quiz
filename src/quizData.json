      "explanation": "The mods that add extra weight only do so on DLC weapons, so on non-DLC weapons like the Carnifex you can get the extra bonuses on these mods \"for free\"."

        }
      ],
      "answer": 4,
      "explanation": "The other methods listed might be better in certain situations but they all take time to perform, while pushing the medigel button when not downed immediately cancels the reload animation."

      "instructions": "Say an enemy is afflicted by a damage-over-time effect (DOT) from incendiary ammo dealing 50 damage each second for 3 seconds. After 1 second you shoot them again and they receive another identical DOT. How much total damage will the enemy receive from the two DOTs?",
      "choices": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "label": "Each DOT ticks on its own, so (50 * 3) + (50 * 3) = 300 total damage"

        }
      ],
      "answer": 3,
      "explanation": "Multiple instances of the same DOT have their damage combined which ticks over the duration of a single DOT. This can be exploited with a fast-firing gun like the Reegar to build DOTs that tick for huge amounts of damage quickly."

      ],
      "answer": 4,
      "explanation": "If for example the target is an Atlas and you use a cobra missle to blow it up along with an Assault Trooper, there is a high chance the next target will be an Assault Trooper due to how the wave enemy budget is calculated."

        }
      ],
      "answer": 4,
      "explanation": "Shooting the plates off of the shoulders, knees, and groin will stun the Atlas and deal extra damage, and shooting the back vent deals extra damage like a headshot. The canopy is not a weak point, although if using a weapon with enough penetration you may be able to score a double hit by shooting through the canopy from certain angles."

      ],
      "answer": 4,
      "explanation": "Once charged, weapons like the Arc Pistol can be fired any time even while sprinting, while stunned, while dodging, etc. This is also why a Geth Hunter can sometimes shoot you while stunned; its Geth Plasma Shotgun is chargeable."

      "answer": 4,
      "explanation": "Enemy spawns are unlimited on wave 11 so it's easy to get overwhelmed if you stay in one spot. Instead, kite the enemies around the map in a circle such that you arrive back at the extraction point shortly before extraction."
